The files in "pairwise" are based on the string matching work by Avi Shmidman and Moshe Koppel (Dicta), consolidating the differing results when (in comparing texts **A** and **B**), text **A** is base or text **B** is base. 

The files in "to_many" consolidate these files around the Bible, Mishnah, etc. as base. These tables add two additional fields for grouping:
     
     
* Canonical citation (the lowest level citation for the base text: the biblical verse, mishnah, talmud page, etc.)
* Reference Range (the longest ranges with overlapping citations)
