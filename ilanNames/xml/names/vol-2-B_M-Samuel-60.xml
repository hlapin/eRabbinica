                                which alphabet the name appears. Negev reports about it in this
                                early popular publication but not in his final report (see next
                                note). It may have been in Greek or in Nabatean. I present it here
                                in Hebrew because Negev’s publication is in this language, see
                                Introduction 2.4.</note>
               <note xml:id="d2e49146" n="110"> In this popular book in Hebrew, Negev
                                writes: “Samuel, the artist who produced this fresco, signed his
                                name under one of his paintings” (translation and paraphrase mine).
                                Nowhere (not even in his book Greek Inscriptions from the Negev (Jerusalem 1981), where he published all
                                other inscriptions from Mampsis, and mentioned the exact fresco he
                                claims this Samuel has painted, has he published this
                                inscription.</note>

               <note xml:id="d2e49170" n="112">According to J.
                                Goodman, “The Frescoes in Building XII,” in A. Negev (ed.), The Architecture of Mampsis, Final Report. Vol I: The Middle and Late Nabatean Period (Qedem
                                26; Jerusalem 1988) 147, the frescoes are no older than 222 and thus
                                are unlikely to be Christian. The name is, therefore, Jewish and so
                                must the artist have been.</note>
